Event Management System

An Object-Oriented Java application designed to manage events through a multi-role user system. This project simulates a real-world event management platform with a clear user interface and file-based data storage.
🔧 Key Features

    Three main user roles:

        Admin

            Super Admin – Full control over the system.

            Room Manager – Manages available rooms for events.

            Category Manager – Manages event categories and tags.

        Organizer – Creates and manages events.

        Attendee – Registers and participates in events.

    Event lifecycle management using OOP principles:

        Event creation, editing, and deletion

        Room and category assignment

        Attendee registration and tracking

    Clean User Interface built with JavaFX Scene Builder and styled with CSS

    Persistent data storage using a simple file-based system (no external database required)
